in this we store the value in key and pairs

map<string,int>m;
m[key] = value;   // insert and change

insert , emplace
count 
erase
find
size ,empty , erase

In map the output prints in ascending order accoriding to key 
for example if there is no key amit and om
so first amit will print and then om as o comes ater a.


there are two types of map 
1 multi map   (in multi map we can store multiple keys)
2 unordered map  (in ordered map the value is stored in random manner and the value can't be duplicate)
